> **The backend service powering the offline-first Next Bus ecosystem.**

**Next Bus Backend** is a REST API built with **FastAPI** that supports the Next Bus mobile application.
Its primary responsibility is to **accept, validate, and persist crowdsourced transit data** while enforcing basic data-quality rules.

This repository exists mainly as a **supporting service** for the frontend, but it is also intentionally designed to demonstrate **backend system design, API discipline, and cost-aware engineering**.

---

## 📖 Context

> *Crowdsourced data is only useful if you can trust it.*

The frontend handles offline usage and UX.
The backend solves the **data integrity problem**:

* Who is allowed to write?
* How often can updates be sent?
* How do you prevent accidental or malicious spam without heavy infrastructure?

This service goes beyond simple CRUD by embedding **business rules directly into the API layer**.

---

## ✨ Features

### Core API Capabilities

* **Public Read APIs** — Fetch routes and timings without authentication
* **Authenticated Writes** — Reporting and modifications require Firebase login
* **Role-Based Access Control**

  * **Admins:** Manage routes and metadata
  * **Users:** Submit timing updates
* **Offline Client Sync Support** — Accepts delayed, batched updates

### Data Integrity Controls

* **Logic-Based Rate Limiting**

  * Enforces **1 update per user per route per minute**
  * Violations return **HTTP 429**
  * Idempotency handling is planned but not yet implemented
* **Strict Request Validation**

  * All payloads validated using Pydantic models

---

## 🧠 Engineering Highlights

### 1. Rate Limiting Without External Infrastructure

Instead of Redis or API gateways, rate limiting is implemented directly in application logic:

* Last update timestamps are checked in Firestore
* Requests exceeding limits are rejected early
* Keeps architecture simple and cloud costs low

This approach is intentional for a **low-traffic, cost-constrained system**.

---

### 2. Offline-First Friendly API Design

The backend is tolerant of:

* Delayed updates
* Batched writes
* Reordered submissions

This complements the frontend’s offline queue and sync engine.

---

### 3. Future-Ready Data Storage

While no ML models are currently active:

* Raw timing data is stored in a way that supports **future analysis or prediction**
* Schema decisions avoid locking into premature assumptions

---

## 🧑‍💼 What This Backend Demonstrates (For Recruiters)

This repository demonstrates:

* **API design with real constraints**
* **Authentication & RBAC using Firebase**
* **Backend business-logic enforcement**
* **Cost-aware architectural decisions**
* **Clear separation of concerns (frontend vs backend)**

It is intentionally **not over-engineered**.
